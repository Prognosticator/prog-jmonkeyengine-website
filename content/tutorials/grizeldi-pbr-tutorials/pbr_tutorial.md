A continuing YouTube series helping users take leap from using the regular `Lighting.j3md` material to `PbrLighting.j3md`.

------

### First part of my tutorial series in which I explain how to use jmonkeyengine's Physically Based Rendering pipeline. Intended for people who already understand how to use the regular Lighting.j3md shader, but have no idea how PBR works.
