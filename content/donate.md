There are two ways to donate to jMonkeyEngine and its community:



<a href="https://opencollective.com/jmonkeyengine"><h2>Fund our Collective with PayPal / Credit Card / Bank Transfer </h2></a>
<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;align-items:center;margin-top:1rem">
<a href="https://opencollective.com/jmonkeyengine">
    <i style="font-size:6rem;color:var(--highlightFg)" class="fa-solid fa-building-columns"></i>
</a>
<p style="margin-left:2rem;">
We accept donations through our collective at <a href="https://opencollective.com/jmonkeyengine">opencollective/jmonkeyengine</a>.
<br>
The collective is managed by the Core Developers and it will be used to promote and fund the development and maintenance of the engine and its related services.
<br>
<br>
<i>Backers can leave a message to the community that will be featured in the homepage.</i>
