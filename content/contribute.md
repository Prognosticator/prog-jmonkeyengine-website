# Contributing to jMonkeyEngine

There are several ways to contribute toward the jMonkey project. All of the jmonkey source code is hosted on github and follows the git procedure.

## Contributing to the Engine

To contribute to the engine you must clone the jMonkeyEngine repository, commit your changes and submit a Pull Request (PR). Pull Requests are reviewed by staff members and contributors before it is determined whether they will be approved and merged. 

Visit the [jMonkeyEngine repository](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine) to clone the repository.

## Contributing to Documentation

Documentation comes in two forms: [JavaDoc](https://javadoc.jmonkeyengine.org) and the [Wiki](https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org).

To submit changes to the JavaDoc you must follow the same procedure as **Contributing to the Engine**. To submit changes or add new pages to the wiki you must clone the [wiki repository](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/wiki) and follow the same procedure as **Contrubuting to the Engine**.

## Reporting Bugs

To report any bugs in the engine or errors in documentation you can submit a new issue in the corresponding repository.
