A continuing YouTube series helping users take leap from using the regular `Lighting.j3md` material to `PbrLighting.j3md`.

First part of my tutorial series in which I explain how to use jmonkeyengine's Physically Based Rendering pipeline. Intended for people who already understand how to use the regular Lighting.j3md shader, but have no idea how PBR works.

Second part of my tutorial series in which I explain how to use jmonkeyengine's Physically Based Rendering pipeline. In this part we answer the question what are the light probes and why do we need them.
