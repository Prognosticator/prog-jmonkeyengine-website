        <p>
            <p>Leave everything behind and try your hand at captaining a ship on the frontier of the galaxy. Customize it piece by piece to tackle whatever adventures await you. Take on crime lords and space pirates in battle, undercut corporations that are monopolizing business, influence the galactic stock market, and become the most successful captain you can be.</p>
<p>In this sci-fi adventure sandbox game, you have the opportunity to explore and influence the universe around you and make your own path. Take on open ended missions that will have a lasting effect on your surroundings, and embark on an adventure to discover the mysteries of Lightspeed Frontier.</p>
<p>Faster than light travel has recently been made available for the common middle-class galaxy dweller, and you’ve just saved up enough money to purchase your first standard command pod. This pod can have it’s functionality and size extended with additional modular building blocks, such as engines, cannons, lasers, scanners, software, and more.</p>
<p>As you acquire more modules for your ship, your ship class will also increment unlocking more missions and special actions. While you start out as just a tiny fighter-class ship, you can eventually reach the pinnacle of modular ship development and be upgraded to the final Infinity class! Each class has its own pros and cons, as far as firepower, speed, maneuverability, etc, but slowly acquiring more modules through whatever means necessary will open up more opportunities for you.</p>
<p>While exploring the universe, you may encounter memorable NPCs, corporations, scavengers, programmers, asteroid belts, space stations, and more. Every encounter with an NPC will either make you enemies or allies with them, depending on if you choose to help them or stab them in the back. This could result on a bounty being put on your head, or more challenging (but rewarding) work from them in the future. There are also many different ways for you to make your mark in the universe. You can invest in mining equipment if you want to be a raw materials salesman, or BFGs if you’re more the bounty hunter type.</p>
<p>Battling other ships is a key part of the game, and also one of the challenges of traversing the frontier. You will need to utilize a multitude of different weapons, maneuvering techniques, and even physics to destroy your opponents (like ramming, or hurling asteroids for instance). And it goes without saying, the brochure from the command pod salesman did not mention anything about the constant and ceaseless life-threatening encounters you would face in the outer reaches of the universe.</p>
<p>Most the parts you can come across are made according to faction orders and designs. In the outer rim, old pre-warp tech has been modified by rogue gangs and refit to still work in this day and age, albeit with questionable durability. The industrial belt of the galaxy is controlled by the Industrial Conglomerate - with everything designed for sheer strength. And tensile strength too. In the very core of the galaxy resides the United Research Alliance always has the most high tech gear known to man.</p>
<p>Space is a massive opportunity for investment and profit which brings interstellar corporations to the frontier&rsquo;s outposts and space stations. These corporations can provide you with shipping contracts, protection work (or even more shady jobs once you earn their trust) or you can just simply invest into their stocks.</p>
