    <h1>
        jMonkeyEngine 3.3.2 released
    </h1>
    




    <p>JMonkeyEngine version 3.3.2 is here!</p>
<p>After 3 months of beta testing, the Java game engine&rsquo;s long-awaited v3.3 release arrived on 30 March. With it came exciting new features:  AppState ids, light-probe blending, a better ragdoll control, and an animation system rewritten from the ground up.</p>
<p>As often happens, a few key bugfixes missed the cutoff for v3.3.0-stable. In its wake, the JMonkeyEngine team came together and identified a handful of existing fixes that could be safely backported into v3.3.  With the help of volunteers, candidate builds received extensive testing on multiple platforms.  Their efforts culminated in version 3.3.2-stable, a production-ready patch release from the v3.3 line.</p>
<p>The 3.3.2-stable libraries are tested, approved, and ready-to-rock!</p>
<p>For projects built with Maven or Gradle, artifacts are available from JCenter.  If you are looking for the source code, go to <a href="https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.3.2-stable">https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.3.2-stable</a></p>
<p>At this time, version 3.3 of the JME Software Development Kit (based on Netbeans 11) is still undergoing testing and is not recommended for production use.  Until it&rsquo;s ready, development with the v3.3 libraries can proceed using the 3.2 SDK (based on Netbeans 8) or general-purpose IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
